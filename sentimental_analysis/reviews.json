Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Exactly what I was hoping these would be!  I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.  I have worn the outfit twice already, and I can already tell it will be a frequent choice for me in the months ahead!\n\n  \n"},

I am glad I went with my instincts on this purchase. The pants are unique and beautifully made. I wore black boyshort undies with the orange multi-colored pants and folks could not see a thing!

I have paired them with jackets and heels to t shirts and tennis shoes and I always get compliments on them.  I saw them in these fun patterns and tried them.  More compliments.  I am going to order a couple more for summer.  The prints seem to be just a bit lighter than the solid material.  Since I will only wear the prints in summer, I like the fact they are a lighter material.  SOOOO cute and comfortable.  Get some!\n\n  \n"},

I never read the material, so I assumed it would be entirely spandex but very much prefer thus as it appears higher quality.Details: colors are as I saw them in picture. Vibrant and vivid. The elastic on the back is perfect, giving me the right fit!Length: as per my body specs above, for me the length is perfect. I can wear somewhat flat shoes (will have a slight drag) or shoes with (comfortably/visually appealing) that are about 2\", perhaps 3\".Hips: I'd say there is room for one more inch of hips/buttocks combined.Summary: I've never posted a review on an item immediately after trying it on, so I'd like to say this speaks volume on how pleased I am, so far. I think the price can be justified but alsi I had a partial gift card I applied towards the balance, so I don't think I would have paid full price.  I still need to test how they will feel as I wear them throughout the day and how they will be after I wash them. I will post an update if there are any issues.\n\n  \n"},

These are by far the most beautiful as far as fabric color & pattern.Pros: As I said beautiful, colors vibrant. Fit was exactly what I hoped for. I'm vertically challenged (4'10.5\") & pretty fluffy. These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together!

Given that there are large swathes of white on the ones I got, it impossible to wear these pants on their own.  I had to run out and get a pair of white capri length leggings to wear underneath.2.  The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.  But because the fabric has a busy print, it really isn't that noticeable, except to me.Otherwise, these are FABULOUS!\n\n  \n"},

I wore them as high waist pants with a white ruffle top to church. I felt like I was floating all day while wearing these pants. They are so comfortable that I did not want to change after church as I usually can't wait to do. I loved sharing the fair trade background of the company and I loved knowing the name of the seamstress of my pants. Buying these pants just feels right! Wearing these pants just feels GOOD!I want to add a comment about the \"see through\" reviews. I almost did not purchase these pants because of those reviews. I am glad I went with my instincts on this purchase. The pants are unique and beautifully made. I wore black boyshort undies with the orange multi-colored pants and folks could not see a thing! Some people may want to wear nude color undies (whatever works for you).Trust this review...you will not regret buying these pants AND supporting a small sustainable, fair trade business.\n\n  \n"},

I am going to order a couple more for summer.  The prints seem to be just a bit lighter than the solid material.

The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.  I have worn the outfit twice already, and I can already tell it will be a frequent choice for me in the months ahead!\n\n  \n"},

I loved sharing the fair trade background of the company and I loved knowing the name of the seamstress of my pants. Buying these pants just feels right! Wearing these pants just feels GOOD!I want to add a comment about the \"see through\" reviews. I almost did not purchase these pants because of those reviews. I am glad I went with my instincts on this purchase. The pants are unique and beautifully made. I wore black boyshort undies with the orange multi-colored pants and folks could not see a thing! Some people may want to wear nude color undies (whatever works for you).Trust this review...you will not regret buying these pants AND supporting a small sustainable, fair trade business.\n\n  \n"},

These are by far the most beautiful as far as fabric color & pattern.Pros: As I said beautiful, colors vibrant. Fit was exactly what I hoped for. I'm vertically challenged (4'10.5\") & pretty fluffy. These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},

I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed. Even with the sheerness of the material, I was ready to keep them, but the crotch bunching is not good for me. Sadly, I will be returning these.\n\n  \n"},
{"stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  They are pants but so flowy they look like a skirt. I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

Given that there are large swathes of white on the ones I got, it impossible to wear these pants on their own.  I had to run out and get a pair of white capri length leggings to wear underneath.2.  The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.  But because the fabric has a busy print, it really isn't that noticeable, except to me.Otherwise, these are FABULOUS!\n\n  \n"},

I am going to order a couple more for summer.  The prints seem to be just a bit lighter than the solid material.

I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag).

Given that there are large swathes of white on the ones I got, it impossible to wear these pants on their own.  I had to run out and get a pair of white capri length leggings to wear underneath.2.  The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.  But because the fabric has a busy print, it really isn't that noticeable, except to me.Otherwise, these are FABULOUS!\n\n  \n"},

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed.

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.  I have worn the outfit twice already, and I can already tell it will be a frequent choice for me in the months ahead!\n\n  \n"},

I wore them as high waist pants with a white ruffle top to church. I felt like I was floating all day while wearing these pants. They are so comfortable that I did not want to change after church as I usually can't wait to do. I loved sharing the fair trade background of the company and I loved knowing the name of the seamstress of my pants. Buying these pants just feels right! Wearing these pants just feels GOOD!I want to add a comment about the \"see through\" reviews. I almost did not purchase these pants because of those reviews. I am glad I went with my instincts on this purchase. The pants are unique and beautifully made. I wore black boyshort undies with the orange multi-colored pants and folks could not see a thing! Some people may want to wear nude color undies (whatever works for you).Trust this review...you will not regret buying these pants AND supporting a small sustainable, fair trade business.\n\n  \n"},

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag).

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

These are by far the most beautiful as far as fabric color & pattern.Pros: As I said beautiful, colors vibrant. Fit was exactly what I hoped for. I'm vertically challenged (4'10.5\") & pretty fluffy. These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.

They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue.

These are by far the most beautiful as far as fabric color & pattern.Pros: As I said beautiful, colors vibrant. Fit was exactly what I hoped for. I'm vertically challenged (4'10.5\") & pretty fluffy. These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},

I have paired them with jackets and heels to t shirts and tennis shoes and I always get compliments on them.  I saw them in these fun patterns and tried them.  More compliments.  I am going to order a couple more for summer.  The prints seem to be just a bit lighter than the solid material.  Since I will only wear the prints in summer, I like the fact they are a lighter material.  SOOOO cute and comfortable.  Get some!\n\n  \n"},

I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed. Even with the sheerness of the material, I was ready to keep them, but the crotch bunching is not good for me. Sadly, I will be returning these.\n\n  \n"},
{"stars": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  They would be a 5 star product except for 2 things:1.  The fabric is very lightweight, and as a result quite sheer.  Given that there are large swathes of white on the ones I got, it impossible to wear these pants on their own.  I had to run out and get a pair of white capri length leggings to wear underneath.2.  The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.  But because the fabric has a busy print, it really isn't that noticeable, except to me.Otherwise, these are FABULOUS!\n\n  \n"},

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.

I love the pants. I am 5'4\" tall and about 110 pounds and the XS fit great, except...the crotch. I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed. Even with the sheerness of the material, I was ready to keep them, but the crotch bunching is not good for me. Sadly, I will be returning these.\n\n  \n"},

The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together!

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.  I have worn the outfit twice already, and I can already tell it will be a frequent choice for me in the months ahead!\n\n  \n"},

I never read the material, so I assumed it would be entirely spandex but very much prefer thus as it appears higher quality.Details: colors are as I saw them in picture. Vibrant and vivid. The elastic on the back is perfect, giving me the right fit!Length: as per my body specs above, for me the length is perfect. I can wear somewhat flat shoes (will have a slight drag) or shoes with (comfortably/visually appealing) that are about 2\", perhaps 3\".Hips: I'd say there is room for one more inch of hips/buttocks combined.Summary: I've never posted a review on an item immediately after trying it on, so I'd like to say this speaks volume on how pleased I am, so far. I think the price can be justified but alsi I had a partial gift card I applied towards the balance, so I don't think I would have paid full price.  I still need to test how they will feel as I wear them throughout the day and how they will be after I wash them. I will post an update if there are any issues.\n\n  \n"},

These are by far the most beautiful as far as fabric color & pattern.Pros: As I said beautiful, colors vibrant. Fit was exactly what I hoped for. I'm vertically challenged (4'10.5\") & pretty fluffy. These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},

Some people may want to wear nude color undies (whatever works for you).Trust this review...you will not regret buying these pants AND supporting a small sustainable, fair trade business.\n\n  \n"},

These are by far the most beautiful as far as fabric color & pattern.Pros: As I said beautiful, colors vibrant. Fit was exactly what I hoped for. I'm vertically challenged (4'10.5\") & pretty fluffy. These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

(It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed.

I can wear somewhat flat shoes (will have a slight drag) or shoes with (comfortably/visually appealing) that are about 2\", perhaps 3\".Hips: I'd say there is room for one more inch of hips/buttocks combined.Summary: I've never posted a review on an item immediately after trying it on, so I'd like to say this speaks volume on how pleased I am, so far.

They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue.

I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.  I have worn the outfit twice already, and I can already tell it will be a frequent choice for me in the months ahead!\n\n  \n"},

I wore them as high waist pants with a white ruffle top to church. I felt like I was floating all day while wearing these pants. They are so comfortable that I did not want to change after church as I usually can't wait to do. I loved sharing the fair trade background of the company and I loved knowing the name of the seamstress of my pants. Buying these pants just feels right! Wearing these pants just feels GOOD!I want to add a comment about the \"see through\" reviews. I almost did not purchase these pants because of those reviews. I am glad I went with my instincts on this purchase. The pants are unique and beautifully made. I wore black boyshort undies with the orange multi-colored pants and folks could not see a thing! Some people may want to wear nude color undies (whatever works for you).Trust this review...you will not regret buying these pants AND supporting a small sustainable, fair trade business.\n\n  \n"},

I love the pants. I am 5'4\" tall and about 110 pounds and the XS fit great, except...the crotch. I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed. Even with the sheerness of the material, I was ready to keep them, but the crotch bunching is not good for me. Sadly, I will be returning these.\n\n  \n"},

Given that there are large swathes of white on the ones I got, it impossible to wear these pants on their own.  I had to run out and get a pair of white capri length leggings to wear underneath.2.  The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.  But because the fabric has a busy print, it really isn't that noticeable, except to me.Otherwise, these are FABULOUS!\n\n  \n"},

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag).

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.

I can wear somewhat flat shoes (will have a slight drag) or shoes with (comfortably/visually appealing) that are about 2\", perhaps 3\".Hips: I'd say there is room for one more inch of hips/buttocks combined.Summary: I've never posted a review on an item immediately after trying it on, so I'd like to say this speaks volume on how pleased I am, so far. I think the price can be justified but alsi I had a partial gift card I applied towards the balance, so I don't think I would have paid full price.  I still need to test how they will feel as I wear them throughout the day and how they will be after I wash them. I will post an update if there are any issues.\n\n  \n"},

These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape.

I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.  I have worn the outfit twice already, and I can already tell it will be a frequent choice for me in the months ahead!\n\n  \n"},

I have paired them with jackets and heels to t shirts and tennis shoes and I always get compliments on them.  I saw them in these fun patterns and tried them.  More compliments.  I am going to order a couple more for summer.  The prints seem to be just a bit lighter than the solid material.  Since I will only wear the prints in summer, I like the fact they are a lighter material.  SOOOO cute and comfortable.  Get some!\n\n  \n"},

I love the pants. I am 5'4\" tall and about 110 pounds and the XS fit great, except...the crotch. I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed.

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.

I have paired them with jackets and heels to t shirts and tennis shoes and I always get compliments on them.  I saw them in these fun patterns and tried them.  More compliments.  I am going to order a couple more for summer.  The prints seem to be just a bit lighter than the solid material.  Since I will only wear the prints in summer, I like the fact they are a lighter material.  SOOOO cute and comfortable.  Get some!\n\n  \n"},

I love the pants. I am 5'4\" tall and about 110 pounds and the XS fit great, except...the crotch. I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed. Even with the sheerness of the material, I was ready to keep them, but the crotch bunching is not good for me. Sadly, I will be returning these.\n\n  \n"},

The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops. I can see myself buying yet another color when I can afford it (they are not cheap, but are hand-crafted according to a tag). Some reviewers comment that the fabric is see-through, but I don't think it's noteworthy unless perhaps you are holding a light up to it.\n\n  \n"},

The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.

I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue.

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape.

And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.

I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together!

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

I love the pants. I am 5'4\" tall and about 110 pounds and the XS fit great, except...the crotch. I don't know if the inseam is sewn too far to the rear or if it's the shape of my behind, but no matter how low or high I place the waist, the crotch bunches up and shows the \"v\" between my legs. I was considering keeping them and tying a scarf around my waist to hide it, but I don't want to have to do that. I am very disappointed. Even with the sheerness of the material, I was ready to keep them, but the crotch bunching is not good for me. Sadly, I will be returning these.\n\n  \n"},

The construction is a little uncomfortable.  The crotch could use a little more depth to keep them from puckering unatractively in front.

I love the fitted waist that accommodates whether I'm at a slimmer or heavier weight. The fabric is cool and slightly stiff, so it holds its shape. (It feels like stiff cotton but there is no 'materials' tag -- it could use this.) I am 5'8\" and about 145 lbs., and the size Large is great for my various up-and-down weights. I am leggy and the length is slightly above my shoe. The pants make it easy to get out of comfy clothes and get dressed up, because they are so comfortable and the colors go with many different tops.

The material IS very light and slightly see through, as others have mentioned, however if you wear a pair of nude colored undies it won't pose a problem :-) I am 5'4\" and about 190lbs. I normally wear a size 12/14- Large pant and I got these in an XL and they fit me VERY comfortably. In my opinion, get 1 size up for adequate comfort and you will NOT be disappointed. I have received lots of compliments on these and people actually think it is a skirt :-P I'm super cheap and almost died after I paid the $38 for these but I am happy I did because I really do like them a lot :-) I paired them with a dark green top, also from Amazon, called the LL Womens Boat Neck Dolman Top, for $12.95 and they work wonderfully together! Both are super flowey and comfy. Bring on the warm weather!!! :-D\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Exactly what I was hoping these would be!  I was looking for some fun palazzo pants for the summer season, that have a nice \"flow\" when I walk.  I stumbled upon these and immediately loved the print.  The pants fit as expected - I ordered a small (I'm 5'5\" and about 105) and they fit very comfortably around my waist.  And I appreciated the obvious care that went into packaging them and even including the name of the person who made them.  My only \"boo\" is that the pants are just slightly long on me if I'm wearing flats, but that's mainly because I have shorter than average legs - ALL full-length pants are a problem in this regard.  And actually in this case it's not so bad; they don't drag the ground at all, and I've already experimented with folding the waist as an alternative.  I also ordered the halter top the company makes, and am so glad I did - it's the perfect compliment to the pants.  I have worn the outfit twice already, and I can already tell it will be a frequent choice for me in the months ahead!\n\n  \n"},

I wore them as high waist pants with a white ruffle top to church. I felt like I was floating all day while wearing these pants. They are so comfortable that I did not want to change after church as I usually can't wait to do. I loved sharing the fair trade background of the company and I loved knowing the name of the seamstress of my pants. Buying these pants just feels right! Wearing these pants just feels GOOD!I want to add a comment about the \"see through\" reviews. I almost did not purchase these pants because of those reviews. I am glad I went with my instincts on this purchase. The pants are unique and beautifully made. I wore black boyshort undies with the orange multi-colored pants and folks could not see a thing!

I never read the material, so I assumed it would be entirely spandex but very much prefer thus as it appears higher quality.Details: colors are as I saw them in picture. Vibrant and vivid. The elastic on the back is perfect, giving me the right fit!Length: as per my body specs above, for me the length is perfect. I can wear somewhat flat shoes (will have a slight drag) or shoes with (comfortably/visually appealing) that are about 2\", perhaps 3\".Hips: I'd say there is room for one more inch of hips/buttocks combined.Summary: I've never posted a review on an item immediately after trying it on, so I'd like to say this speaks volume on how pleased I am, so far. I think the price can be justified but alsi I had a partial gift card I applied towards the balance, so I don't think I would have paid full price.

These pants fit so well & no muffin top (purchased the xl). And wow of wows, I don't even need to hem them. A pair of 3\"-3.5\" platforms & I am good to go. They are 100% cotton (yay!), so I will probably air dry only.Cons: The material is thin, very thin. Nude color panties should solve this issue. Out of the package, the material is quite stiff (as 100% un-washed cotton typically is). Just need to launder the sizing out.I love them, Well worth the money.\n\n  \n"},
